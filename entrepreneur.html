It’s a natural human reaction.</p><p>Many aspiring entrepreneurs suffer from such a psychological phenomenon. They tell themselves stories of what life as an entrepreneur will be like… but once they actually live the life of an entrepreneur they discover the reality is anything but.</p><p>Often times, these stories come in the form of “I’ll be happy when…”</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><em dir="ltr">I’ll be happy when</em>… I start a business.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><em dir="ltr">I will be happy when</em>… I am making $100,000 a year from my business.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><em dir="ltr">I will be happy when</em>… I sell my business and become a milllionaire.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><em dir="ltr">I will be happy when</em>… [fill in the&nbsp;blank].</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">One story aspiring entrepreneurs tell themselves is that they will be happy when they find some of the many myths associated with entrepreneurship — <em dir="ltr">flexibility, wealth, notoriety, etc.</em></p><p>But, from my own experience as an entrepreneur, these illusions aren’t discovered or achieved through entrepreneurship:</p><ul><li><strong dir="ltr">I will be happy when I have more <em dir="ltr">Flexibility</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> — my life hasn’t become more flexible after building JotForm (and it wasn’t <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/hire-slowly-grow-slowly/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">anything close to flexible during the first ten or so years</a> while building it). After 12 years, my responsibility today is only bigger… <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/better-decision-making-mini-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">managing</a>, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/startup-employee-retention/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">hiring</a>, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/developing-products-for-32m-users/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">strategizing</a> and worrying.</li></ul><blockquote><p>If, as an entrepreneur, you’re working 40 hours a week and “worrying” an additional 40 hours outside of work… is your life truly flexible?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong dir="ltr">I will be happy when I have greater <em dir="ltr">Wealth</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> — while JotForm has been a modest success for myself and my team, for every modest entrepreneurial success, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/everything-learned-about-failure/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">there are thousands of failures</a>. And, regardless of the Cinderella stories you hear in the media, the reality of entrepreneurial failure is anything but a fairy tale. There’s nothing poetic about going tens of thousands of dollars in debt because your dream didn’t take off. Where it concerns entrepreneurship, I would argue that wealth isn’t something that should be expected… <em dir="ltr">I’d argue it’s a rare exception. </em>In fact, <a href="https://www.sokanu.com/careers/entrepreneur/salary/" rel="nofollow noopener" dir="ltr">according to this study</a>, the average entrepreneur makes roughly $5/ hour starting out and established entrepreneurs make $62/ hour. Yes, that’s good money, but far from being a millionaire.</li><li><strong dir="ltr">I will be happy when I have more <em dir="ltr">Notoriety</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> — another misconception of entrepreneurship is that it leads to notoriety or fame. While yes, some entrepreneurs like Musk and Zuckerberg are celebrated like rock stars, most of us go completely unnoticed. Instead of trying to make it to a magazine cover, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/dominating-tech-news/" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr">I choose picking olives and spending quality time with my family</a>.</li></ul><p>So, when you truly look at flexibility, wealth and notoriety… you realize that entrepreneurship isn’t necessarily the best path to take to achieve these things.</p><p>Entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. Just because it’s cool or you are born to become an entrepreneur doesn’t mean your friends should become one.</p><p>If you want more flexibility, you might as well work for a remote-friendly company. If you seek wealth, you might as well make money working in real estate, sales or investment banking.</p><p>While there’s nothing wrong with these things, they can’t necessarily be found through entrepreneurship… or at least it’s not the easiest path to find them.</p><p dir="ltr">Before making the choice to become an entrepreneur (or an employee for that matter), we can ask ourselves what will truly make us happy and be extremely realistic with ourselves… because it might just be <em dir="ltr">focusing illusion</em> getting the better of us.</p><div dir="ltr">
